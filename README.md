Virtuoso
--------

Nanobrowser uses the Virtuoso triple store via its SPARQL endpoint. You should
use a separate Virtuoso instance for nanobrowser. Make sure that the SPARQL
endpoint is accessible to nanobrowser but not directly to web users.

The following commands have to be executed to configure the Virtuoso triple
store:

    GRANT EXECUTE ON DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD TO "SPARQL";
    GRANT DELETE ON DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD TO "SPARQL";
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DB.DBA.SPARUL_CLEAR TO "SPARQL";
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DB.DBA.SPARQL_INSERT_DICT_CONTENT TO "SPARQL";
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DB.DBA.SPARQL_DELETE_DICT_CONTENT TO "SPARQL";

To allow for text indexing (not yet implemented):

    RDF_OBJ_FT_RULE_ADD(null, null, 'All');
    VT_INC_INDEX_DB_DBA_RDF_OBJ();

To load a (large) file of nanopubs in N-Quads format to Virtuoso:

    ttlp_mt (file_to_string_output ('file.nq'), '', 'http://example.org/foo', 512);
